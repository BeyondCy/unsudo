# unsudo

When you have %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL in /etc/sudoers, but want to run programs that don't need sudo access, take the wheel group away.

I do not guarantee that there are no loopholes in this/ways for a program to get wheel back. If you know of one specifically, let me know.

I mean, besides abusing being able to read .Xauthority. I know about that one. >.>
